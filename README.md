# Obeliskial Options

(updated for 1.1.02)

This is an **Across the Obelisk** mod that contains a number of options to alter gameplay.

Broadly speaking, this mod makes the game easier; I encourage you to try harder madness levels, corruption modifiers and personal challenges to re-balance the game.

MULTIPLAYER: Ensure that all players have the same settings or things are likely to break.

## Regular Options

| **Adjusted Shop Rarity**         | true    | Modifies shop rarity based on current madness/corruption. This also makes the change in rarity from act 1 to 4 _slightly_ less abrupt.                                        |
| **Allow Profanities**            | true    | Ignores the profanity filter.                                                                                                                                                 |

## Installation

Install [BepInEx](https://across-the-obelisk.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_AcrossTheObelisk/).
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/stiffmeds/Obeliskial-Options/releases) and put it in your BepInEx _plugins_ folder.
Change settings in the BepInEx\config\com.meds.obeliskialoptions.cfg (appears after first run) OR use a configuration manager (I use [this one](https://github.com/sinai-dev/BepInExConfigManager)) to set them ingame. If you use a config manager you need to change BepInEx\config\BepInEx.cfg to have HideManagerGameObject = true rather than HideManagerGameObject = false.

I guess open a github issue? :)
