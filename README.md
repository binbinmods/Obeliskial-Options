# Obeliskial Options

This is an **Across the Obelisk** mod that contains a number of options to alter gameplay. 

Broadly speaking, this mod makes the game easier; I encourage you to try harder madness levels, corruption modifiers and personal challenges to re-balance the game.

## Regular Options

| Option                           | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                   |

| **Adjusted Shop Rarity**         | true    | Modifies shop rarity based on current madness/corruption. This also makes the change in rarity from act 1 to 4 _slightly_ less abrupt.                                        |
| **Allow Profanities**            | true    | Ignores the profanity filter.                                                                                                                                                 |
